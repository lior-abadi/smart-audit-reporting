# Summary of contracts in Scope

## Core

### GolomTrader.sol

Description:

This contract acts as the NFT trade matcher with 3 different functions for the 3 different ordertypes, ordertype 0 for filling ask for NFT, 1 for filling bid of an NFT, 2 for filling bid of any NFT from a particular collection ensuring that the supplied proof demonstrates inclusion of the tokenId in the associated merkle root, if root is 0, then any token can be used to fill the order. After filling RewardDistributor, contract is called for saving fees generated by each address and distributing rewards.




## Rewards

### RewardDistributor.sol

Types of reward distribution:

- Golom rewards for Traders selling NFT and exchanges that created the signed orders 
- Inflationary Golom rewards and fee rewards for Vote-escrowed Golom stakers

How rewards are calculated.

- Vote escrowed staked golom (described below) are entitled to all ether fees stored in ```epochTotalFee``` as well as inflationary golom rewards (calculated as ```uint256 stakerReward = (tokenToEmit * rewardToken.balanceOf(address(ve))) / rewardToken.totalSupply();```) pro-rata to their power
- Sellers of NFT per epoch are entitiled to ```rewardTrader[epoch]``` rewards of each epoch pro-rata to the fees
- Exchange addresses that creates the orders are entitiled to ```rewardExchange[epoch]``` rewards of each epoch pro-rata to the fees
- All ether collected on this contract before ```startTime``` is stored as fees in ```epochTotalFee``` mapping of epoch 0 and given to Vote-escrowed stakers
- Contract also mints daily golom token based on https://docs.golom.io/emissions with ```dailyEmission``` being 600,000 tokens



## Vote escrow

### VoteEscrowDelegation.sol

This contract inherits VoteEscrowCore.sol which is a fork of Andre's solidly project (https://github.com/solidlyexchange/solidly/blob/master/contracts/ve.sol) and implements delegation for upgrading other contracts by voting.

Solidly is a fork of curve voting mechanism which makes each lock as an NFT and allows it to be freely transferable.



# Summary of contracts NOT in Scope

## Core

### Emitter.sol 

This contract emits any valid signed order as an indexed event for easy querying. This contract will be deployed on polygon.
